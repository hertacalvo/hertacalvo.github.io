## Inspiration
OpenBook is a supplemental learning source for anyone who wishes to learn any subject the same way they would in a classroom or lecture setting. OpenBook is an alternative to traditional textbooks that gives the tools to build high-quality books with little effort OpenBook operates as a website where users can browse, view, open, and create OpenBooks.
## What it does
OpenBook allows creating custom books through a simple syntax similar to markdown which allows formatting tools such as code-blocks, latex, images/videos, hyperlinks, and much more. We also created a website to show openBooks created from other users.  Anyone can view, download, or even edit an openBook - like Wikipedia. Professors can include examples, link to outside sources, and even modify an openBook to fit their course perfectly.

## How we built it
Our project is split into two sections, a webpage that allows uploading and viewing openBooks and a python script to generate an openBook from a custom markdown-like syntax we created

## Challenges we ran into
Deploying a website and building a robust interpreter to handle user error.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Building an interpreter similar to markdown that allows outputting a well-formatted output that includes syntax highlighting, latex, and code blocks

## What we learned
User design and building tools that are easy to use for people who aren't familiar with latex. 

## What's next for OpenBook
We plan on working with professors to integrate this into classrooms. We also would like to further implement our online website where users can share their books, save their favorites, and collaborate to improve other books.  We hope to integrate a system like git to help the collaboration process and eventually create an online editor.
